function [i, t, tp, I, Ip, L] = GreenAmpt (Ko, rainfall, theta, hf)
%% GreenAmpt
% Infiltration model at constant rainfall.
%
%% Syntax
%
% |[i, t, tp, I, Ip, L] = GreenAmpt (Ko, rainfall, theta, hf)|
%
%% Model description
% This approach assumes constant rainfall infiltration and uses a "time
% compression approximation" as described by Kutilek (1980). The model was
% developed by Green and Ampt in 1911.
%
%% Assumptions
% * The soil in the wetted region has constant properties. 
% * The matric potential at the wetting front is constant and equal to hf.
%
%% Inputs
%       Ko = Hydraulic conductivity in the wetting front. This value is
%       different from saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and it is
%       usually assumed to be 1/2*Ksat. Unit is in [cm/h]. Scalar.
%       
%       rainfall = vector of two elements. The first element, rainfall(1), is
%       the rainfall rate in [cm/h], and the second element, rainfall(2),
%       is the duration of the rainfall event in [h].
%
%       theta = vector of two elements. The first element of the vector is 
%       the initial volumetric water content, and the second element is the
%       volumetric water content behind the wetting front which is assumed
%       to be equal to the effective porosity [cm3/cm3] (Rawls et al., 1983).
%
%       hf = scalar describing the matric potential of the soil (negative value) at the wetting 
%       front, usually represented as hf. This is the matric potential corresponding to thetaf.
%       It is sometimes assumed to be similar to the bubbling pressure [cm].
%   
%% Outputs
%       i = infiltration rate [cm/h].
%       tp = Ponding time [h].
%       I = cumulative infiltration [cm].
%       Ip = Cumulative infiltration at ponding time [cm].
%       L = Depth of the wetting front [cm].
%
%% Example 
%
% For a soil with a |Ko|=0.44 cm/h receiving a rainfall with intensity of
% 5 cm/h for a period of 2 hours, initial soil water content of 0.250
% cm3/cm3 and a soil volumetric water content in the wetting front assumed
% to be a value similar to the total porosity, and matric potential at the
% surface at ponding time is equal to zero (|ho|=0) and a matric potential at
% the wetting front similar to the bubling pressure of the soil |hf|=-20 cm,
% then the function in Matlab can be called as follows:
%
% [i, tp, I, Ip] = GreenAmpt (0.44,[5 2] , [0.25 0.5], -20);
%%
%       Ponding time = 0.10 hours
%       Wetting front depth = 14.12 cm

% Define variables
r = rainfall(1);
tr = rainfall(2);
delta_theta = theta(2)-theta(1);
ho = 0;
delta_h = ho-hf;
I = 0:0.01:r*tr; % Define iteration steps. Maximum cumulative infiltration... 
% should be equal to rainfall intensity (r) times the duration of the rainfall event (tr).

% Step 1 -  Caluclate hypothetical ponded infiltration (Ip) corresponding to ip=r.
Ip = delta_theta*delta_h /(r/Ko-1);

% Step 2 - Calculate time required for rainfall to supply Ip.
tp = delta_h*delta_theta/(r*(r/Ko-1));
% tp can also be calculated as tp=Ip/r, for constant r.

% Pre-allocate memory
tponded = nan(1,length(I));
iponded = nan(1,length(I));
t = nan(1,length(I));
i = nan(1,length(I));
for j=1:length(I)
    % Step 3 Calculate constant ponding curve
    tponded(j) = 1/Ko * (I(j)- delta_h*delta_theta*log((delta_h*delta_theta+I(j))/(delta_h*delta_theta)));
    iponded(j) = Ko*(1+delta_h*delta_theta/I(j));
    
    % Step 4 - Calculate time t at which each arbitrary cumulative infiltration (I) occurs.
    if I(j)<Ip
       t(j) = I(j)/r;
    elseif I(j)==Ip
        t(j) = tp;
    else
        t(j) = tp+1/Ko * (I(j)-Ip- delta_h*delta_theta*log((delta_h*delta_theta+I(j))/(delta_h*delta_theta+Ip)));
    end
    
    % Step 5 - Calculate infiltration rate
    if t(j)<tp
        i(j) = r;
    elseif t(j)>=tp || t(j)<=tr
        i(j) = Ko*(1+delta_h*delta_theta/I(j));
    else
        i(j) = 0;     
    end  
    
    L = I./delta_theta; 
end

% Truncate variables at the end of the rainfall event
j = t <= tr; %times before the end of the rainfall event
I = I(j); L = L(j); i = i(j); iponded = iponded(j); t = t(j); tponded = tponded(j);
